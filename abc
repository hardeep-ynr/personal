After we look at the documentation for GSS data, we observe that multiple types of sampling has been used for different years. While quota sampling was used for a few years, full probability sampling and multi-stage sampling was used for other years.

For simplicity, we will assume random sampling for all years and hence assume the condition of generalizability to US population. We can not infer any kind of causality as the sampling is not done through random assignment and the data collection process does not reflect an experimental study.
