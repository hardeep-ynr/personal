I have known Hardeep for the past 3.5 years since my term as his Manager in Mu Sigma. During that period, I had many formal and informal interactions with him.
During his tenure as a budding business analyst in Mu Sigma, Hardeep showcased high grade of analytical thinking and problem-solving ability. His ability to understand problems – both business and analytical – helped his team, organization and clients in defining complex business problems and designing efficient solutions to them.
Hardeep displayed tremendous ability to understand advanced statistical concepts during his time at Mu Sigma which was evident in the project where he developed a log-log multiple regression model to test and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns run by the customer care and after sales division of a Fortune 50 US automobile client for sales of spare parts to their dealers. He understood all the rigorous assumptions and theoretical foundations behind the model and even helped his peers understand the mathematical intricacies of the model. He used SAS as the programming language to build the model and to test the model assumptions while the data was fetched using Oracle SQL. His programming acumen can be gauged from the fact that he learned and implemented the model end-to-end in SAS within a few weeks. He was able to achieve this owing to his dedication and the high degree of work and business ethics. As far as I know him, he has been able to pick up programming concepts very quickly with the help of his own research and if required, with the help of senior colleagues. 
During my association with him, Hardeep received the ‘Impact Award’ which is the highest award by Mu Sigma for showing excellent analytical skills in defining problems and designing effective solutions for the client. He was the youngest analyst to receive the award in Mu Sigma at that point in time.
Despite challenging timelines at work, Hardeep has never shied away from working on his career goals. His dedicated pursuit of CFA certification (He is appearing for CFA level in June this year) speaks volume of his dedication towards discovering and understanding more about the field of finance.
When it comes to communication, Hardeep has been straightforward and always spoke his mind with his peers. He communicated effectively and concisely on weekly client calls as well as on email interactions with the client and/or his colleagues. On most occasions, he drove client calls on his own explaining the analyses performed by him in a lucid manner to the client. He even participated keenly in account level initiatives focused on written and oral communication skills to improve his skills further. 
A few areas I observed where he could improve was on his ability to delegate work and better management of time.
I would strongly recommend Hardeep for the MSCF program as I think he is a great student and will be a great candidate for the program.
