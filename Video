I wanted to move to a career in finance while I was working in Mu Sigma for an Australian Regional Bank as I had started developing an interest in the field and there were very limited opportunities in Mu Sigma. For achieving this, I decided to pursue the Chartered Financial Analyst certification and cleared Level 1 in the first attempt. While I was preparing for CFA Level 2, I started looking out for professional opportunities for a quantitative finance role simultaneously. In addition to my preparation for these two levels of the certification, I reviewed statistical concepts of probability and inferential statistics that I had previously applied in Mu Sigma. These concepts proved vital for preparation for job interviews.
When I was interviewed by CRISIL, I was sufficiently prepared and successfully cleared all the interviews. I was subsequently hired by them to work as a Risk Analyst for an asset management client based in New York. The experience in CRISIL has exposed me to multiple problems in Risk Management which include implementation of statistical VaR back-tests based on a first order Markov Sequence, creation of custom spread series factor for risk modeling of tranches of Credit Risk Transfer deals and creation of dashboard of risk metrics for alternative funds managed by the client. This experience has greatly shaped my future career aspirations to continue in the domain of Risk Management where I want to work on more complex and challenging problems facing the industry
